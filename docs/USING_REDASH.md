# Using redash to access to the live database

We have an installation of Redash for anybody to inspect the live database. It's hosted at [db.traducir.win](https://db.traducir.win) and you can access using the following details:

Username: `db@traducir.win`
Password: `letMeInPleeeease`

## Getting your own account

If you use that account, anybody can delete and edit your queries. If that works for you, then you don't need to do anything else.

Now, if you'd like your own user, just [fill this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_1T7-oDK1x_hJ2rRAPvA0OYrps6HYFSqyvlLAQJ66Ml1qQg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and we'll send you an email with instructions to activate your account.
